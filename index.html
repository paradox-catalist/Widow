And it set all of the basic memory allocation core definitions mathematics structures it includes even smart pointers and garbage collection that is used in everything else we do one way or another. And it also has a lot of nice features such as an advanced string systems including tokinizer an easy to customize markup system for reading or writing in ASCII and for the binary files it has smart link and multidimensional link list that has a number of sorting allocation and removing any member anywhere in the chain. it defines 2D 3D and 4D vectors and matrix 2x2 3x3 and 4x4 that has over the years been tested in real world scenarios tell it's robust and dynamic enough for me to say in confidence low level coulacation orrutine this can handle and has been used for with speed and its clean. and this is just one library in the Widow development system.</h3>
